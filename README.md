# Guess My Number Game

## Description
A single player game that generates random numbers between 1 and 20, collects user input and checks input against random number. It also keeps track of scores.
Used HTML & CSS to create the layout and used JavaScript to implement functionality through conditionals, event listeners and functions. Applied the DOM manipulation concept here.
